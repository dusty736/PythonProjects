Homework 2

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file and your modified
dna_analysis.py program.


Problem 1:

(No answers in this file.)

Problem 2:

GC-content: 0.43029262963

Problem 3:

a.) Commenting out "gc_count = 0" created an error in the output
because the variable gc_count in the loop was no longer defined.
b.) Commenting out "nucleotides = filename_to_string(filename)"
created the error that the name nucleotides was not defined.
This means that the loop that counts the content of the dna
wasn't able to run.

Problem 4:

AT-content: 0.56970737037

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7680812

Problem 6:

Sum of G+C+A+T counts: 26980735
Total count: 27000000
Length of nucleotides: 27000000

The sum of the G+C+A+T counts is less than the total
count and length of the nucleotides because there
are outliers that are not defined by G,C,A, or T
that are included in the total count/ length of the
nucleotides that are not included in the counts of each
individual nucleotide.

Because the count of G+C+A+T represents the actual count
of the individual G, C, A, and T nucleotides, the sum_counts
variable that contains G+C+A+T should be used in the denominator
of our GC, and AT contents.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

moderate GC content

Collaboration:

None
