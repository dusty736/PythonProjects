Answer to Problem 7:

The p value for the Iranian election is consistently hovering between 0.03 and 0.04.  Because the measured p value is below the 5% level, I will say that the result is statistically significant and I reject the null hypothesis that the Iranian was not fraudulent.

Answer to Problem 8:

The p values for the United States election is consistently hovering above 0.9.  This is far above the 5% level, I can say with confidence that there is no statistical significance against the null hypothesis that the US election was genuine.
