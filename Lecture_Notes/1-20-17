File I/O
Files store information when a program i snot running
Operations:
open, close, read, and write

A file object represents data on your disk drive
A filename states where to find the data on your disk drive

myfile = open("datafile.dat") Gets data from datafile.dat and saves to myfile
myfile = open("datafile.dat", "r") opens for reading

for line_of_text in myfile:
  process line_of_text

Writing to a file in python
myfile = open("output.dat", "w")

Example:
num_words = 0
big_word_list = []
silly_file = open("silly.txt", "r")
for line in silly_file:
  #print line,
  word_list = line.split()
  #print word_list
  num_words += len(word_list)
  big_word_list.extend(word_list)

silly_file.close()
print "total words in file: ", num_words
print big_word_list

HW3:
Look at recording

Sets: A collection of values without duplicates or order.
Use curly braces now {}
No duplicates

Ex:
x = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1}
Returns
x
{1, 2, 3}

Construct from a list:
odd = set( [1, 3, 5] )
empty = set( [] )
