List Insertion
mylist.append(x)
-Extend the list by inserting x at the end
mylist.extend(l)
-Extend the list by appending all the items in the argument list
mylist.insert(i, x)
-insert an item before the given position
-a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list
-a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent to a.append(x)

lst3 = lst2 doesn't make a copy.  a change to 3 is a change to 2
lst3 = lst2[:] makes a copy of lst2

Example of pulling from lists.  Need to pull a single value, not a list.
["four", "score", "and", "seven", "years"][2]
'and'

["four", "score", "and", "seven", "years"][[0,2,3]]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: list indices must be integers, not list

["four", "score", "and", "seven", "years"][0,2,3]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: list indices must be integers, not tuple

["four", "score", "and", "seven", "years"][[0,2,3][1]]
'and'

Example:
def index(somelist, value):
  num_words = 0
  for word in somelist:
    if word == value:
      return num_words
    num_words = num_words + 1

gettysburg = ["four", "score", "and", "seven", "years"]
print index(gettysburg, "and")
print index(gettysburg, "years")
