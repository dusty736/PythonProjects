Think about data for final project:
  -What questions can be answered?

How to develop cod:
Write in words the application and output of the function
  -Write tests for the function

Decide upon an algorithm
  -Implement step by step in English
  -Test it using paper and pencil

Translate into code
  -Decompose into functions
  -Test Program

Test cases for airport program:
-One flight has really long delay
-Only flight that originate from "SEA"
-1 Day of datafile
-One day missing

Steps in English:
-Iterate through the months
-Iterate through destinations
-Iterate through days and sum the delay times, divide by number of destinations
-Create a dictionary that stores avg delay time to the key do_analysis
-Print day and avg.

Actual Steps:
-Read in the csv file, determine which airports
-Calculate/Create lists of days and delays
-Write the txt file
-Plot the graph
