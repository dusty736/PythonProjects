Two types of abstraction:
Abstraction: Ignoring/hiding some aspects of a thing
  -In programming, ignore everything except the specification or interface
  -The program designer decides which details to hide and to expose

Procedural Abstraction:
  -Define a procedure/function specification
  -Hide implementation details

Data Abstraction:
  -Define what the datatype represents
  -Define how to create, query, and modify
  -Hide implementation details of representation and of operations
    -Also called "encapsulation" or "information hiding"
